## Gestalt laws, an old passion of mine.

When we talked about Gestalt laws during our lecture, I immediatly thought about the [dontdeadopeninside](https://www.reddit.com/r/dontdeadopeninside/) and [CrappyDesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/) subreddits. If you've never checked them out, I can only recommend you to do so. They basically concatenates the very best of the worst of design, and were basically used as the a precious database for this lecture. What was truly insightful for me during this lecture was the fact that I had always laughed about problems like these without ever even knowing that they were related to Gestalt Laws.

## Bad applications of Gestalt Laws and how to solve them ?

I may apologise for the first example because it took me several minutes to understand what was supposed to be said on the picture...

{{< figure src="/Gestalt1.jpg" title="Wash your hands and say your prayers because Jesus & germs are everywhere..." >}}

The main problem in this example lies in the law of **common-region**. Since each and every part of the text is separated with boundaries, we tend to think that each and every region is a part of the sentence and so, we read it from left/top to right/bottom but it does not make any sense... Even if we were able to bypass that terrible design, a problem would remain and it has to do with the law of **continuity** : since words are sliced up it is hard to keep track of which word is next. We might read : "Wash P / your hands AY" :confused:   

To solve the problems encountered while trying to keep the same "spirit" of structure, I'm going to propose a quick fix.

>I tried to keep an identical structure but erased vertical lines to ease the reading process. To further emphasize the vertical structure, I kept the horizontal boundaries and reinforced them using different colors. I aligned words to keep continuity and we end up with something which is I believe much more readabale than before.   
   
As for the next example we once again are confronted with a terrible understanding of basic Gestalt laws : 
{{< figure src="/Gestalt2.jpg" title="Love requires us to know when to be silent and when to speak up" >}}   

This is not nearly as bad as the previous one but it's still completely senseless if you let your brain read it carefreely. Once again it's a problem of **common-region** and **continuity**, if we care to keep the same structure, we could do something like this :
{{< figure src="/Gestalt2Solved.jpg" title="Proposed solving solution" >}}  

I tried to keep the same visual theme (color and shape), but decided to rearrange the sentence. I emphasized the important words (bold) and now, you can fluently read and understand the sentence. More could be done on the side of designing but we'll call it a day here.

## Honourable mention

I could not possibly finish this lab without preventing one of the fewest Gestalt Laws hack there is.
