## Unity ?

At the beginning of this course, we had already installed Unity because of our Computer Graphics course. Obviously I had to make sure that my Unity setup was the right one and I also had to add the Android Build Support as suggested by the lab tutorial.  

Other than that, I did not have any problems setting up my environment and decided to practice Unity by working on my Computer Graphics' project.
I've decided to show you the final result so that you may see how far I've come from my Unity's beginnings.

You can check my [GitHub](https://github.com/celol/3DPlatformer) to find my project (you'll need to build it first) and try to beat my highest score ! :wink:
