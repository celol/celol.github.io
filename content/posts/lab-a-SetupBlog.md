## Why Hugo ?
I decided to use Hugo because of the challenge it offered. At first, because I was getting behind on the lab, I thought of using a platform that would allow me to instantly and easily create a blog like we see so much nowadays. But I decided not to fall in the *Dark Pattern* of laziness and got my hands-on Hugo.
## How I got started ?
At first, I had chosen the [Paper Mod](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-papermod/ "Looks good, but not ideal") which had everything to satisfy me : it was clean, minimalist and readable.    
But I had major issues with the quick start linked with the project. Some of the modifications suggested could not be implemented because the author didn’t bother translating them to the toml format.   
Basically I didn't have the freedom to modidy everything I wanted and it bothered me since I wanted this blog to be truly mine.


Anyways after several attempts, I decided to start over and found another template that was also a great fit.   
It is the template you’re currently browsing and the built-in tutorial was easy to follow and offered a lot of useful modifications. I also chose it because of the presence of tags which I think will be pretty useful once articles start to pile up.
I also added a browser icon thanks to this tutorial : https://www.kiroule.com/article/add-favicon-to-hugo-based-website/
The emoji cheat sheet is also a must have since the template supports the use of them : https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/ 
And finally to help the efficient writing of articles, I found this site to be the best : https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#headings 
I also had major issues for image implementation, thankfully I was able to solve it using this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14494747/how-to-add-images-to-readme-md-on-github )
