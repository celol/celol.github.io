      <description>Why Hugo ? I decided to use Hugo because of the challenge it offered. At first, because I was getting behind on the lab, I thought of using a platform that would allow me to instantly and easily create a blog like we see so much nowadays. But I decided not to fall in the Dark Pattern of laziness and got my hands-on Hugo.
How I got started ? At first, I had chosen the Paper Mod which had everything to satisfy me : it was clean, minimalist and readable.</description>

      <description>It has been a long way from the very first course of HCI to the publishing of this article, but we are here. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain more in depth the choices I made and the reasoning behind it in my next post about our Hugo Lab. See you there ! ðŸ‘‹
  Happy of my success    &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.&amp;rdquo; Or something along those lines.</description>
