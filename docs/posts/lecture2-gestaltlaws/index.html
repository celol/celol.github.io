			Using wonderful subreddits to show and correct bad applications of Gestalt laws

			<h2 id="gestalt-laws-an-old-passion-of-mine">Gestalt laws, an old passion of mine.</h2>
<p>When we talked about Gestalt laws during our lecture, I immediatly thought about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dontdeadopeninside/">dontdeadopeninside</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/">CrappyDesign</a> subreddits. If you&rsquo;ve never checked them out, I can only recommend you to do so. They basically concatenates the very best of the worst of design, and were basically used as the a precious database for this lecture. What was truly insightful for me during this lecture was the fact that I had always laughed about problems like these without ever even knowing that they were related to Gestalt Laws.</p>
<h2 id="bad-applications-of-gestalt-laws-and-how-to-solve-them-">Bad applications of Gestalt Laws and how to solve them ?</h2>
<p>I may apologise for the first example because it took me several minutes to understand what was supposed to be said on the picture&hellip;</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/Gestalt1.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Wash your hands and say your prayers because Jesus &amp; germs are everywhere...</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The main problem in this example lies in the law of <strong>common-region</strong>. Since each and every part of the text is separated with boundaries, we tend to think that each and every region is a part of the sentence and so, we read it from left/top to right/bottom but it does not make any sense&hellip; Even if we were able to bypass that terrible design, a problem would remain and it has to do with the law of <strong>continuity</strong> : since words are sliced up it is hard to keep track of which word is next. We might read : &ldquo;Wash P / your hands AY&rdquo; ðŸ˜•</p>
<p>To solve the problems encountered while trying to keep the same &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of structure, I&rsquo;m going to propose a quick fix.
<figure>
    <img src="/Gestalt1solved.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Proposed solving solution</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tried to keep an identical structure but erased vertical lines to ease the reading process. To further emphasize the vertical structure, I kept the horizontal boundaries and reinforced them using different colors. I aligned words to keep continuity and we end up with something which is I believe much more readabale than before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the next example we once again are confronted with a terrible understanding of basic Gestalt laws : 
<figure>
    <img src="/Gestalt2.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Love requires us to know when to be silent and when to speak up</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>This is not nearly as bad as the previous one but it&rsquo;s still completely senseless if you let your brain read it carefreely. Once again it&rsquo;s a problem of <strong>common-region</strong> and <strong>continuity</strong>, if we care to keep the same structure, we could do something like this :
<figure>
    <img src="/Gestalt2Solved.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Proposed solving solution</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>I tried to keep the same visual theme (color and shape), but decided to rearrange the sentence. I emphasized the important words (bold) and now, you can fluently read and understand the sentence. More could be done on the side of designing but we&rsquo;ll call it a day here.</p>
<h2 id="honourable-mention">Honourable mention</h2>
<p>I could not possibly finish this lab without preventing one of the fewest Gestalt Laws hack there is.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/Shades.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Outplayed</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
