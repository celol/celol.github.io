			<h2 id="why-hugo-">Why Hugo ?</h2>
<p>I decided to use Hugo because of the challenge it offered. At first, because I was getting behind on the lab, I thought of using a platform that would allow me to instantly and easily create a blog like we see so much nowadays. But I decided not to fall in the <em>Dark Pattern</em> of laziness and got my hands-on Hugo.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-got-started-">How I got started ?</h2>
<p>At first, I had chosen the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-papermod/" title="Looks good, but not ideal">Paper Mod</a> which had everything to satisfy me : it was clean, minimalist and readable. <br>
But I had major issues with the quick start linked with the project. Some of the modifications suggested could not be implemented because the author didnâ€™t bother translating them to the toml format.<br>
Basically I didn&rsquo;t have the freedom to modidy everything I wanted and it bothered me since I wanted this blog to be truly mine.</p>
<p>Anyways, after several attempts, I decided to start over and found another template that was also a great fit.<br>
It is the template youâ€™re currently browsing and the built-in tutorial was easy to follow and offered a lot of useful modifications. I also chose it because of the presence of tags which I think will be pretty useful once articles start to pile up.
I also added a browser icon thanks to this <a href="https://www.kiroule.com/article/add-favicon-to-hugo-based-website/">tutorial</a>. As I really wanted to adapt the theme to my taste and make it look personal, I believe the icon is a good way of achieving it.</p>

            <h4>Isn&#39;t it beautiful ?</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Since the template supports the usage of emojis and even if I&rsquo;m not going to overuse them, knowing how to use them is still a good <a href="https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/">opportunity.</a> ðŸ’ª</p>
<p>And finally to help the efficient writing of articles, I found this <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">site</a> to be the best. As I had never written any Markdown documents, knowing the basic syntax was a must in order to make my content more readable.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-i-host-my-blog-">How did I host my Blog ?</h2>
<p>Looking closely at my blog domain, you will notice that it&rsquo;s being hosted on GitHub pages. I chose this way because, since I am going to host the code relative to our labs on GitHub, why not hosting everything there ?</p>
<p>The main issue with the Hugo built-in tutorial is that it does not extensively explain how to host on GitHub while using a theme. As I kept getting the same errors with my initial build (the one of Hugo&rsquo;s quickstart), I decided to do things my way.</p>
<p><strong>How to host your Hugo Blog, CÃ©lestin&rsquo;s way:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Follow Hugo&rsquo;s quickstart guide</li>
<li>If you want to use a theme, download the zip archive, extract it and copy the folders inside in your main directory (replace duplicate if needed)</li>
<li>In your config.toml, add publishDir = &ldquo;docs&rdquo;</li>
<li>From now on, you can follow Hugo&rsquo;s tutorial : <em>Deployment of Project Pages from /docs folder on master branch</em></li>
</ol>
<p>My way is not one advised by Hugo&rsquo;s tutorial (at least for the theme part), but it&rsquo;s the only way I found for my website to work. Professionnally speaking, this not an ideal way of building a website, since the docs repository is only a part of the GitHub repo, but since I can build my blog locally at first it is safe to use.</p>
