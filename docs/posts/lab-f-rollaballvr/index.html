<p>Well, this is not the happiest I&rsquo;ve been. I had kept the VR Lab as far away as I could from me but maybe I should have put more thought in it because it ended up as a complete failure but I still want to write a blogpost for it.</p>
<p>I had basically started the lab on Evry Campus on an Occulus Rift but switched to a Quest right after. 
I followed the advices from the lab, got the same importing errors for my Roll A Ball android package and I was happy. The problems started when I tried to debug my game using Occulus Link.</p>
<p>My scene looks something like this :</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/Scene.PNG"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Isn&#39;t it beautiful ?</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Basically, I had added a skybox, changed the material of my floor and added the roll a ball on the table. But I when I hit play in Occulus Link, this is what I end up with :</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/OculusScreenshot1604263987.jpeg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Meh...</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Basically I was unable to have any VR interaction. I thought at first this was a package problem and I tried to uninstall &amp; reinstall the VR packages required to make it run but it did not change anything. I reupdated Unity, Occulus and it didn&rsquo;t change either.
Since Carl is living with me, has the same PC and used the same headset I tried to copy the maneuvers he did to get it to work but it did not seem like it would work on my machine.</p>
<p>Then, I thought about the mobile implementation I did and realised that I had completed it without debugging available. So I decided to complete the lab, adding some music (Adding a component AudioSource to the OVRCameraRig does the trick I guess) and then I build the app without erros and using SideQuest I transferred it onto my headset. I only got a black screen at launch and nothing was happening&hellip;</p>
<p>You can find my project on my <a href="https://github.com/celol/RollABallVR">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="why-it-didnt-work-">Why it didn&rsquo;t work ?</h2>
<p>Well I bear the entire responsibility for the failure of this lab. I didn&rsquo;t give it as much time as I should have and I should have asked more questions earlier. My overall feeling about this lab is the fact that I never truly expected for a VR App to be so complicated to implement : there are numerous steps some that I had trouble understanding .
I believed that since VR was getting more and more popular, its implementation would be more simple but it was not the case.</p>
