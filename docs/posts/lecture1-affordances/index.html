<p>When we talked about affordances in our course, the main example that I kept in mind was the one about door handles. I had never truly thought about their design, but once we talked about it, I was able to vividly remeber the many times in which I pushed instead of pulled and wondered who was the designer of such an atrocity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why my first example of a daily affordance is this door handle:<br>
<figure>
    <img src="/door.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>A bad affordance</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>This is the door handle that allows me, each and every day, to enter my flatshare&rsquo;s building. And I&rsquo;ll explain just below, why it is one of my freshest memories in my door handles' repertoire.</p>
<p>As for the next example, it was pretty hard for me to find a good affordance. That&rsquo;s because good affordances are not as <em>striking</em> as bad ones. But after some intensive research, I ended up choosing another handle, and that is the one of my chamber&rsquo;s window : 
<figure>
    <img src="/window.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>A good affordance</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<h2 id="why-are-these-affordances-good--bad-">Why are these affordances good / bad ?</h2>
<p>The door handle is a bad one because the handle is the same inside or outside the building, but the door is supposed to be <strong>pushed</strong> while <strong>entering</strong>  and <strong>pulled</strong> while <strong>exiting</strong>. Thus, since the form is the same my sometimes tired brain assumes that <em>&ldquo;Form follows function.&quot;</em> is respected everywhere and I mess it all up almost twice a week.</p>
<p>The main problem about this handle, apart from being the same for two different purposes, is the fact that its shape is a weird hybrid between a pull / push affordance. The latter is also explanatory for my numerous mess ups.</p>
<p>Concerning my window&rsquo;s handle, I believe it to be a great affordance because its various forms truly follow functions</p>

</figure>


<p>Notice how each and every different position of the handle bears a different function of the window. If the handle is facing down I don&rsquo;t want to pull it towards or away from me. Rotated at a 90 degrees angle it want to pull it towards like a door and I expect to open it as such. Finally, at 180 degrees, I still want to pull it but I kinda expect it to be opened vertically, like a lever would open it.</p>
<h2 id="how-could-we-fix-the-bad-one-">How could we fix the bad one ?</h2>
<p>The bad one could be fixed by firstly, choosing two different shapes of handle for the inside and the outside. Furthermore, we should also try to reduce the confusion between a pulling and pushing motion by choosing true functional form like the ones below.</p>
