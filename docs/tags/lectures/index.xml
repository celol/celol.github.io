      <description>Finding a good and a bad affordance. When we talked about affordances in our course, the main example that I kept in mind was the one about door handles. I had never truly thought about their design, but once we talked about it, I was able to vividly remeber the many times in which I pushed instead of pulled and wondered who was the designer of such an atrocity.
That&amp;rsquo;s why my first example of a daily affordance is this door handle:</description>

      <description>Gestalt laws, an old passion of mine. When we talked about Gestalt laws during our lecture, I immediatly thought about the dontdeadopeninside and CrappyDesign subreddits. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never checked them out, I can only recommend you to do so. They basically concatenates the very best of the worst of design, and were basically used as the a precious database for this lecture. What was truly insightful for me during this lecture was the fact that I had always laughed about problems like these without ever even knowing that they were related to Gestalt Laws.</description>

      <description>Finding and documenting two Dark Design Patterns. This lecture has hag a great echo on me, and has helped me realise how sneaky and insidious Dark Design Patterns truly are.
As for the first example I decided to document, I decided to give you a bit of context on how I came across this Dark Pattern. I recently had to change my laptop and I chose this one :   My new setup just for attention, please notice that I&amp;#39;m using it to work   I chose a french market place to buy it and since it was pretty expensive, I wanted to save as much money as I could.</description>
