      <description>Introduction During this course, I had the pleasure of discovering what Recurrent Neural Networks were. Since the evaluation associated to this course is mostly based on my understanding on the course, I&amp;rsquo;ll try and be the clearest possible to show how much I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.
