      <description>A VR Implementation that became a failure. Well, this is not the happiest I&amp;rsquo;ve been. I had kept the VR Lab as far away as I could from me but maybe I should have put more thought in it because it ended up as a complete failure but I still want to write a blogpost for it.
I had basically started the lab on Evry Campus on an Occulus Rift but switched to a Quest right after.</description>
