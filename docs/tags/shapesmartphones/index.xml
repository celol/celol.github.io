      <description>Discussing the evolution of shape of smartphones. Why did they change their shape ?   Simplified evolution   This picture may be considered off topic or too caricatural, but I believe it displays perfectly the evolutions the smartphone&amp;rsquo;s (and cellphone&amp;rsquo;s) shape has faced throughout the years.
